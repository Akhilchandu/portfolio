# Personal-Website

This project was created in order to hone and experiment my HTML, CSS, and Javascript abilities while also having fun and displaying my personality. The layout of the site relied on the use of bootstrap, allowing for responsive elements on all device widths. CSS was used for styling, obviously, and Javascript was used in order to create dyanmic height alignment (since it appears to be difficult to achieve vertical alignment without losing responsiveness), form validation, and other effects. Lastly, the logo was also custom made.

The home page features a broad overview of me and my personality, complete with an about section (with pictures!), a downloadable resume, and even a section that displays pinned projects. However, the portion that I'm the proudest about and took the longest to complete was custom form validation.

The only other page includes a portfolio page that is able to be navigated to through selecting "All Projects" in the appropriate section. Javascript was also used on this page in order to achieve the animations as well as hide sections on click. This page as well as the rest of the site will be updated as more projects are undertaken and completed. Some, however, will not have exclusive detail due to the nature of the project (classified info). 

Although the page, in my opinion, looks well done at its current state, there are still improvements that could be made. For example, the email section in the contact area does not automataically send emails; rather, it causes another app to open or it does not work at all. This could be addressed through using email modules such that the form works as intended. Another adjustment includes the layout of the projects page. The current presentation could be improved, thereby heightening UI/UX

As always, the page is open to any contributions and suggestions - if you would like to propose an addition or change, feel free to reach out to me or create a pull request with your changes.
